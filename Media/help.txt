                        MAMEoX Help
=============================================================

 A - Play selected ROM
 X + B - Move ROM to the "BACKUP" directory (this is to 
         allow the user to "permanently" remove a ROM 
         from the listing, without really deleting the 
         file. Note that there is no way, currently, of 
         adding the file back to the list. You'd have to 
         manually move it back to the ROMs directory
 Y + B - Toggle Option screen
 X     - Show Help file
 Y     - Hold to enter "Super Scroll" mode. In the upper 
         left hand corner of the screen, a letter (or #) 
         will appear. Using the DPAD up and down buttons, 
         you can change the letter, skipping to the 
         section of the list starting with that letter.
 Black - Search for ROM files, culling out clones / 
         keeping clones
 White - Toggle game list (w/o rating and favorite)

 Left Trigger - Move the current ROM cursor up fast
 Right Trigger - Move the current ROM cursor down fast
 DPAD/Left Analog Stick - Move the current ROM cursor 
                          slowly

 Right Analog Stick - Used to set the screen usage 
                     percentage for MAME rendering.

 Moving the stick will resize the green background (which
 is where the game screen will be rendered). This should 
 be sized such that a very small black border is revealed 
 all around the green. Failure to do this will cause 
 clipping (where the parts of the screen are not visibile) 
 or suboptimal usage (where there is a big black border 
 around the game screen)

 Pressing Left Trigger, Right Trigger, and the Black button
 on Joypad 1 will jump to the dashboard.
