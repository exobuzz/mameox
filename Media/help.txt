                        MAMEoX Help
=======================================

 A - Play selected ROM
 X + B - Move ROM to the "BACKUP" directory (this 
         allows the user to "permanently" remove a
         ROM from the listing, without really deleting 
	 the file. Note that there is currently no way
	 to add the file back to the list from within
	 MAMEoX. You will have to manually move it 
	 back to the ROMs directory.
 Y + B - Toggle Option screen
 X     - Show Help file
 Y     - Hold to enter "Super Scroll" mode. At the top
         of the screen, a letter (or # symbol) will 
         appear. Using the DPAD up and down 
         buttons, you can change the letter; 
         skipping to the section of the list 
         starting with that letter.
 Black - Toggle between showing and hiding clones
 White - Toggle extended list mode (with 
         rating and favorite columns)

 Left Trigger - Move the ROM cursor up fast
 Right Trigger - Move the ROM cursor down fast
 DPAD/Left Analog Stick - Move the ROM cursor 
                          slowly

 Right Analog Stick - Used to set the screen usage 
                     percentage for MAME rendering.

 Moving the stick will resize the gold border
 (which denotes the area into which the
 game screen will be rendered). This should 
 be sized such that the entire border just
 barely fits on the screen. Failure to do 
 this may cause clipping (where the parts 
 of the screen are not visibile) or 
 suboptimal usage (where there is a larger 
 than necessary black border around the 
 game screen)

 Pressing Left Trigger, Right Trigger, 
 and the Black button on Gamepad 1 
 will jump to the dashboard.
