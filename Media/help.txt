 ROM List Controls
-------------------

A     - Play selected ROM
X     - Toggle this Help file
Y     - Hold to enter "Super Scroll" mode. 
        At the top of the screen, a letter 
        (or # symbol) will appear. Using the
        DPAD up and down buttons, you can 
        change the letter; skipping to the 
        section of the list starting with 
        that letter.
BLACK - Toggle between showing and hiding 
        clones
WHITE - Toggle extended list mode (with 
        rating and favorite columns)
START - Toggle the start menu, from which
        you can remove ROMs, scan for new
        ROMs, switch to the Options menu,
        the Lightgun calibration screen, 
        etc...

-- List Navigation -------------------------
Left Trigger           - Move the ROM cursor
                         up fast
Right Trigger          - Move the ROM cursor
                         down fast
DPAD/Left Analog Stick - Move the ROM cursor
                         up/down slowly

-- Screen Size -----------------------------
Right Analog Stick - 
        Click the stick to toggle between
        Stretch and Move modes.

        Stretch mode:
        Used to set the screen usage
        percentage for MAME rendering.
        Moving the stick will resize the
        selection screen (this area
        corresponds to the area into which
        the game screen will be rendered). 
        This should be sized such that the 
        blue border just barely fits on the
        screen. Failure to do this may cause
        clipping (where parts of the screen
        are not visible) or suboptimal usage
        (where there is a larger than 
        necessary black border around the
        game screen).

        Move mode:
        Used to set the screen position
        for MAME rendering. Moving the 
        stick will change the position of
        the screen.

-- Exiting MAMEoX --------------------------
Pressing Left Trigger, Right Trigger, and 
the Black button on Gamepad 1 will jump to
the dashboard. You can also exit using the
option in the START menu.
