      - Added Aspect Ratio Correction toggle option

    - DebugLogger.h
      - Added support for dumping debug data to a file in Release mode

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Sources:

    - xbox_FileIO.cpp
      - Added symlink support (code based on submission from Redline)

    - xbox_Main.cpp
      - Put back the call to LoadDriverDataSections that caused
        0.66b to fail when running in Release mode. Put in a note
	to remind me not to take it out again :)

    - MAMEoXUtil.cpp
      - Added symlink support (code based on submission from Redline)

    - xbox_Direct3DRenderer.cpp
      - Added Aspect Ratio Correction toggle option

  - libsmb++\src:

    - SessionPacket.cpp
      - Added #undef errno to fix compiler issues

    - NetBIOSPacket.h
      - Added #undef errno to fix compiler issues


*********************************************************************
Version 0.66b

  - \MAME\src\usrintrf.c
    - Added a call to LoadDriverDataSections()
      in the block of code where the drivers[] array
      is parsed to find a working clone of a ROM that
      is tagged as invalid. This fixes crashes for
      these games (such as Alexx Kid set 1)

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\Gamepad.h
  - \MAMEoX\Sources\Gamepad.cpp
    - Added CGamepad class w/ helper functions for
      button state checking

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\StdString.h:
    - Defined SS_NO_IMPLICIT_CAST to force us to
      use c_str(). Apparently the CStdString class
      cannot be passed as an elipsis argument, which
      is why it sometimes crashes in PRINTMSG macros.
      (See the notes for SS_SAFE_FORMAT in this file)

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\MAMEoX.h
    - Updated version number
    - Save superscroll index when launching the utility XBE
    - Renamed WaitForNoKey and WaitForKey to WaitForNoButton and
      WaitForAnyButton resp.
    - Added LAUNCH_RUN_AS_IF_REBOOTED command to properly handle
      case where MAMEoX.xbe is started instead of default.xbe
    - clonename, manufacturer, year added into MAMEDriverData_t 

  - \MAMEoX\Sources\xbox_Main.cpp
    - Removed unloading of game sections after a game
      was run, this speeds up the return to the game selection
      by quite a bit. (opcode)
    - Hopefully disabled memory card initialization, as it
      causes crashes
    - Changed build process to use custom imagebld.switch
      files, setting the driver sections to \NOPRELOAD as
      originally intended. This allows us to remove the Unload
      and Load general section calls and just load the individual
      sections that we need, speeding up load times.
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
    - Added LAUNCH_RUN_AS_IF_REBOOTED command to properly handle
      case where MAMEoX.xbe is started instead of default.xbe
    - clonename, manufacturer, year added into DriverList (Save)

  - \MAMEoX\Sources\MAMEoXUtil.cpp
    - Added network and directory ini entries to SaveOptions
    - Added "DisableNetworking" option to ensure that networking
      is not started at all if not wanted. For some reason my
      current network setup takes about 40 seconds to boot in debug
      mode, this is a hack until I figure out why.
    - Renamed WaitForNoKey and WaitForKey to WaitForNoButton and
      WaitForAnyButton resp.
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition

  - \MAMEoX\Sources\xbox_FileIO.cpp:
    - Fixed a problem where the file was new'd but not memset to
      0, causing the fileposition and other members to be undefined.

  - \MAME\src\vidhrdw\namcos1.c
    - Reverted back to MAME 0.60 version of this file
      some update after 0.60 made it crash the xbox, but
      works fine on the pc version of MAME. This makes
      namco system 1 games work now, whereas before they
      would load the roms then crash when video was 
      started. (opcode)

  - \Sectionize.pl
    - Updated to dump two imagebld.switch files, one for
      debug, one for release. Hopefully this can be used
      to eliminate the need to unload a ton of sections
      before executing each ROM
    - Updated to also sectionize CPU files
    - Fixed a stupid mistake that may have caused some
      driver files not to be loaded when they should've
      been.

  - \imageblddbg.switch
  - \imagebld.switch
  - \DBGMAMEoX_XBE.bat
  - \MAMEoX_XBE.bat
    - Added files necessary to generate MAMEoX.xbe without
      preloaded XBE sections.
    - These files were immediately removed, as I didn't like
      the way it ended up working, did some profiling, and
      realized that it wasn't making a noticeable difference
      (even in debug mode)

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\main.cpp
    - Hopefully disabled memory card initialization, as it
      causes crashes
    - Improved error messages for missing files
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
    - Added LAUNCH_RUN_AS_IF_REBOOTED command to properly handle
      case where MAMEoX.xbe is started instead of default.xbe
    - clonename, manufacturer, year added into DriverList Load)

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Includes\ROMList.h
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\ROMList.cpp
    - Save superscroll index when launching the utility XBE
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\Help.cpp
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
    - Turned off cursor highlighting
    - Changed text color to blue from green

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\OptionsPage.cpp
      - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
      - Added read-only pages for network and directory options

  - \ZLIB\ZLIB.vcproj
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\MAMEoXLauncher.vcproj
  - \MAMEoX\MAMEoX.vcproj
  - \MAME\MAME.vcproj
  - \libsmb++\libsmb.vcproj
    - Changed all debug versions to use single-threaded debug
      lib to stay inline w/ release mode
    - Fixed problem where MAMEoX project attempted to use the
      release mode libsmb in debug mode, making it impossible
      to automatically build from clean in debug mode (unless
      it was done following a release build)
    - Changed MAMEoX XBE to use runtime checking on uninitialized
      vars and stack validity in debug mode, led to discovery of
      an apparent stack overflow and slight increase of stack size

 --- Specific Game fixes --------------------------------------------
  Ataxx
  Asylum
  Alex Kidd (Set 1) - The ROM is tagged as non-working, but no longer crashes
  U.S. Classic
  Hyper Sports
  Hyper Olympics '84

*********************************************************************
Version 0.65b
  - Fixed a slight glitch in rendering where a grey/white
    bar would show on the left and right of the rendered
    frame. (opcode)

  - Fixed Sound, I think sound is nearly if not 100%
    correct, it sounds exactly like my win32 port
    of MAME as far as I can tell anyway.  Also, sound
    will output to all available speakers, sounds better
    if you have a 5.1 system IMHO. (opcode)

  - Fixed the XDK file debacle, now any files
    that the project references from the xdk will
    now work on any xdk as long as the xdk defined
    the environment variable XDK to point to the
    base dir of the xdk (I think all current xdks
    do this). (opcode)

  - Removed all _RPTx macro calls as they apparently don't
    properly send to xboxwatson.

    Opcode (5/25/03):
  ------------------
    - Added Network settings to INI file
    - Added File Path settings to the INI file
    - Moved INI file to always be in U:\4d414d45\INI\MAMEoX.ini
    - Added SMB support for loading files (ROMS!!) from smb shares
      format of smb share is exactly like xbox media player,
      i.e. smb://user:password@computer/sharedirectory
      as of this release files can only be READ from shares, not Written
    - Changed file handling to not cache files into memory but
      rather load them like the mame core does (not sure if this saves
      memory or not, can't hurt though.)
  ------------------

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\DebugLogger.h

    - White button for advanced game list (not yet)
    - Show With / without Clones in the header
    - ROM list is regenerated via B+A now
