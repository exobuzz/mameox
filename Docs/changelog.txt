Version 0.71.3b (CVS)

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Includes: 
    - MAMEoX.h
      - Upped version number

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Sources: 
    - xbox_FileIO.c
      - Added handling for MAMEoX system files to apply speed
        buffering to all writes/reads
      - Fixed some bugs in the osd_fseek stuff, made fseeks
        immediate, as there's no real need to buffer them (and
        doing so breaks fwrites)
      - Added FILETYPE_MAMEOX_FULLPATH filetype to allow the full
        path of a file to be passed directly to the osd_f* functions

    - xbox_Main.cpp
      - Added handling for MAMEoX system files to apply speed
        buffering to all writes/reads
      - Unloaded the STARTUP section in main instead of the user 
        input code. This frees up most of the memory before the
        game tries to boot at all, rather than waiting until the
        game is finished w/ the input code (the only thing in the
        STARTUP section that is needed after the run_rom call)

    - xbox_JoystickMouse.c
      - Unloaded the STARTUP section in main instead of the user 
        input code. This frees up most of the memory before the
        game tries to boot at all, rather than waiting until the
        game is finished w/ the input code (the only thing in the
        STARTUP section that is needed after the run_rom call)
    
    - System_IniFile.cpp
      - Changed over to use buffered reads/writes to speed up parsing

    - MAMEoXUtil.cpp
      - Fixed bezels (artwork)

    - xbox_Direct3DRenderer.cpp
      - Fixed an off by 1 error when setting texture coords that
        caused clipping of a valid row of pixels
      - Prerotate screenshots before saving the file

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Includes:
    - ROMList.h
      - Added favorite status/num times played support

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources:
    - ROMListScreen.cpp
      - Added favorite status/num times played support
      - Added handling for MAMEoX system files to apply speed
        buffering to all writes/reads

        played
      - Moved progress bar stuff to a central point so it can be used
        from anywhere in the launcher
      - Added filter by "disliked" favorite status

        played
      - Added filter by "disliked" favorite status
      - Added sort by genre
      - Added a simple screensaver (thanks to Noodle for the suggestion)

    - StartMenu.cpp
      - Made menu functions token based instead of cursor position 
        based. This makes it much easier to have fully dynamic menus
      - Made the B button back out of the menu

    - main.cpp
      - Added handling for MAMEoX system files to apply speed
        buffering to all writes/reads
      - Moved progress bar stuff to a central point so it can be used
        from anywhere in the launcher
      - Added "Copy system files from DVD" menu item to allow CD/DVD
        users to copy over hiscore.dat, samples, etc...
      - Made menu functions token based instead of cursor position 
        based. This makes it much easier to have fully dynamic menus
      - Added a simple screensaver (thanks to Noodle for the suggestion)
      - Added screendump command (bound to left analog) for launcher

    - Renamed ROMList, OptionsPage, Help, LightgunCalibrator to 
      xxxxScreen format to increase "findability"
    - Added new class "CBaseMenuView" which takes care of drawing a
      fully resizable menu backdrop. Also removed the old static
      image backdrops.
    - Added new class "CTVCalibrationScreen" which takes care of screen
      resizing/repositioning

*********************************************************************
Version 0.71.2b 


   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Includes: 
    - MAMEoX.h
      - Upped version number

    - InputDevice.h
      - Added virtual input device base class

    - Keyboard.h
      - Added some debug keyboard routines

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Sources: 

    - xbox_main.cpp
      - Moved LoadOptions above the graphics initialization so
        that the VSYNC option is actually used (doh!)
      - Enabled writeback caching for > 64 megs

    - DebugLogger.cpp
      - Fixed: Release not called on vertex buffer after 
        GetStreamSource() function.

    - xbox_fileio.c
      - Added code to allow 4 ROM paths
      - Added buffering for fwrite(), should speed up ROM exiting
        a bit (when saving the input settings it did a whole bunch
        of tiny fwrite(), each of which utilizes WriteFile on an
        unbuffered device, which was _slow_)

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Includes:

    - LightgunCalibrator.h
      - Set the backdrop texture to NULL, like it's supposed
        to be.

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources:

    - main.cpp
      - Reset the texture colorop to "TEXTURE" after rendering
        the subviews. Failure to do so caused it to be left to
        "DIFFUSE" after rendering the lightgun cursor, which led
        to an unusable calibration screen.
      - Added menu option to reload just the ROM status file
      - Enabled writeback caching for > 64 megs

    - ROMList.cpp
      - Changed it so romstatus.xml file is only parsed when scanning
        for new ROMs. This decreases load time between ROMs for large
        XML files.
      - Added public function to force reload the rom status file
      - Fixed Backup feature (yet again, this is what, the 3rd time
        I broke it? I'm still surprised that people use it :))
      - Added code to allow 4 ROM paths
      - Changed backup feature to use CopyFile, as it was broken in 
        the change to multiple ROM paths (break #4 :)). For some 
        reason MoveFile craps out when I try to move across 
        partitions (or maybe just different logical drive letters)
        
    - OptionsPage.cpp
      - Changed the text for "problem ROM" filters
      - Added code to allow 4 ROM paths

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \Sectionize.pl
    - Fixed dep for Operation Wolf
    - Fixed dep for Rainbow Islands
    - Fixed dep for Fighting Roller
    - Fixed dep for Tutankham
    - Fixed dep for Vigilante
    - Fixed dep for Yie ar kung fu
    - Fixed dep for Pooyan

*********************************************************************
Version 0.71.1b

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAME\src:
    - Various: Switched all malloc() calls to "osd_malloc()" so
      we can catch malloc failures and report a sane message to
      the user.


   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Includes: 
    - MAMEoX.h
      - Upped version number

        marking BIOS clones as true clones.

    - xbox_Display.c:
      - Implemented MAME hooks for frameskip/throttle toggling
      - Fixed a problem with the throttling code that seems to
        greatly improve autoframeskip reliability.
      - Added code to toggle the MAMEoX debug console on and off 
        (hold "BACK" for 2 seconds) Note that this only works in
        Debug builds.
      - Reorganized the code a bit to make it nice (broke 
        autoframeskip and UI input checking into separate INLINE
        functions. Moved the input polling around so that throttling
        is always the absolute last thing done in the update 
        function.

    - MAMEoXUtil.cpp
      - Removed history.dat support

    - DebugLogger.cpp
      - Added code to toggle the MAMEoX debug console on and off 
        (hold "BACK" for 2 seconds) Note that this only works in
        Debug builds.
      - Changed the size and color of the debug console
      - Added option to print messages w/out function/file info

    - xbox_Sound.c:
      - Fixed problem that allowed the sound buffer to be overrun
        constantly, causing crackling.

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources:

    - main.cpp
      - Put all textures in a texture set helper class
      - Implemented Start Menu functionality
      - Various changes to support vsync'd display

    - Help.cpp
      - Put all textures in a texture set helper class
      - Integrated new gfx from r4dius

    - ROMList.cpp
      - Put all textures in a texture set helper class
      - Repositioned (very slightly) the scroll icons
      - Used the general message backdrop for the "checking against
        known ROMs" display.
      - Various changes to support vsync'd display
      - Fixed: Superscroll index incorrect after toggling 
        clones/no clones
      - Changed it so that MAMEoX will attempt to keep the 
        cursor on the selected ROM when toggling clones/no clones
      - Fixed: ROM list cache file not updated when ROM is removed
        from the list via "Remove Selected ROM" feature
      - Put in support for various sort modes and filters, these may
        be changed in the options screen.
      - Put in support for ROMSTATUS.XML name colorization (the color
        of the name in the ROM list is changed based on the reported
        working/nonworking status of the ROM).

    - OptionsPage.cpp
      - Integrated new gfx from r4dius

    - BaseView.cpp
      - Added base view class

    - BasePopupView.cpp
      - Added base class for "popup" views (VirtualKeyboard/StartMenu)

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \Sectionize.pl
    - Switched to a more aggressive handling of silent XBE dependencies.
      This will undoubtedly break games that used to work until they are
      reported and thrown into the new families, but it gives up about a 
      meg of RAM.

  - \Desectionize.pl
    - Added commandline argument parsing to allow selective desectionization

Version 0.70.3b

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAME\src:
    - mame.c

      - Reordered input checking to allow lightgun games to
        take input from analog joysticks if no lightgun is
	available

    - inptport.h
      - Bumped IPT_UI_CONFIGURE and all following commands up
        to 2*IPT_EXTENSION to allow room for any input extension
        slots. This fixes a problem in xbox_JoystickMouse.c where
        certain case values (ex 
        IPT_PADDLE|IPF_PLAYER1 + IPT_EXTENSION) are repeated

   -------------------------------------------------------------

      - Added "Is*ButtonPressed()" functions to act across all
        gamepads. This allows users other than X to control
        input (necessary for when a lightgun is in slot 0, for
        instance)

        by the Hawaiian Punk font

    - xbox_JoystickMouse.c

      - Changed all list views to use the new CListView base class      

    - ROMList.cpp
      - Changed all list views to use the new CListView base class

*********************************************************************
Version 0.70.2b

 Note: I finally figured out exactly why 0.66b went bad.
       Everything before and after 0.66b didn't actually
       unload any of the driver sections. When 0.66b unloaded
       the sections, release mode was compiled w/ String Pooling
       enabled. I believe that this allowed code in a given 
       section to become dependent on the string data in another 
       section, creating new silent XBE dependencies that could
       not be resolved. I've disabled String Pooling, and 
       everything seems OK now. Make certain that it is never
       enabled again.
 Note2: It's not just String Pooling, also global optimizations...

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAME\src:
    - cpuexec.c
      - Realized that unloading a section releases all malloc'd
        memory back to the heap. Fixed by first loading the CPU
        to be used, then unloading all CPU sections. This way
        the CPU's that we're using have a refcount of 2, so
        they stay resident.

    - usrintrf.c
      - Simplified section load/unload (merged sections don't
        require separate data/code loads

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Includes: 
    - MAMEoX.h
      - Upped version number


   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Sources: 
    - xbox_JoystickMouse.c
      - Put initialization code in a section that is unloaded
        as soon as it's completed (for a gain of 50k or so)

    - xbox_Main.cpp:
      - Reordered LoadDriverSectionByName to be before the 
        UnloadDriverSections, just in case something was malloc'd
        by the section (and for consistency w/ cpuexec.c).
      - Put initialization code in a section that is unloaded
        as soon as it's completed (for a gain of 50k or so)
      - Signed driver.list file to prevent corruption
       - Put in code to reboot and dump log when missing fonts

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources:

    - main.cpp
       - Signed driver.list file to prevent corruption
       - Put in code to reboot and dump log when missing fonts
       - Put in credits and switched over to new splash screen 
         (thanks goes to r4dius again for the graphics)

    - ROMList.cpp
       - Signed rom.list file to prevent corruption
       - Put in a progress bar for the second half of ROM list
         generation
       - Changed ROM checking code to use std::find instead of
         simple linear search. Should be much faster now (though
         it's supposed to be a rare op, so hopefully nobody will 
         be in a situation to notice :))

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \Desectionize.pl
  - \Sectionize.pl
    - Updated to merge data + code sections

  - \MAMEoX\Includes: 

    - MAMEoX.h
      - Upped version number to 0.67b
      - Added symlink support (code based on submission from Redline)
  
    - xbox_FileIO.h

    - xbox_Direct3DRenderer.h
      - Added Aspect Ratio Correction toggle option

    - DebugLogger.h
      - Added support for dumping debug data to a file in Release mode

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoX\Sources:

    - xbox_FileIO.cpp
      - Added symlink support (code based on submission from Redline)

    - xbox_Main.cpp
      - Put back the call to LoadDriverDataSections that caused
        0.66b to fail when running in Release mode. Put in a note
	to remind me not to take it out again :)

    - MAMEoXUtil.cpp
      - Added symlink support (code based on submission from Redline)

    - xbox_Direct3DRenderer.cpp
      - Added Aspect Ratio Correction toggle option

    - DebugLogger.cpp

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources:

    - OptionsPage.cpp
      - Added read-only listing of symlinks to options
      - Added Aspect Ratio Correction toggle option

    - main.cpp
      - Added Aspect Ratio Correction toggle option

   -------------------------------------------------------------
  - libsmb++\src:

    - SessionPacket.cpp
      - Added #undef errno to fix compiler issues

    - NetBIOSPacket.h
      - Added #undef errno to fix compiler issues


*********************************************************************
Version 0.66b

  - \MAME\src\usrintrf.c
    - Added a call to LoadDriverDataSections()
      in the block of code where the drivers[] array
      is parsed to find a working clone of a ROM that
      is tagged as invalid. This fixes crashes for
      these games (such as Alexx Kid set 1)

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\Gamepad.h
  - \MAMEoX\Sources\Gamepad.cpp
    - Added CGamepad class w/ helper functions for
      button state checking

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\StdString.h:
    - Defined SS_NO_IMPLICIT_CAST to force us to
      use c_str(). Apparently the CStdString class
      cannot be passed as an elipsis argument, which
      is why it sometimes crashes in PRINTMSG macros.
      (See the notes for SS_SAFE_FORMAT in this file)

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\MAMEoX.h
    - Updated version number
    - Save superscroll index when launching the utility XBE
    - Renamed WaitForNoKey and WaitForKey to WaitForNoButton and
      WaitForAnyButton resp.
    - Added LAUNCH_RUN_AS_IF_REBOOTED command to properly handle
      case where MAMEoX.xbe is started instead of default.xbe
    - clonename, manufacturer, year added into MAMEDriverData_t 

  - \MAMEoX\Sources\xbox_Main.cpp
    - Removed unloading of game sections after a game
      was run, this speeds up the return to the game selection
      by quite a bit. (opcode)
    - Hopefully disabled memory card initialization, as it
      causes crashes
    - Changed build process to use custom imagebld.switch
      files, setting the driver sections to \NOPRELOAD as
      originally intended. This allows us to remove the Unload
      and Load general section calls and just load the individual
      sections that we need, speeding up load times.
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
    - Added LAUNCH_RUN_AS_IF_REBOOTED command to properly handle
      case where MAMEoX.xbe is started instead of default.xbe
    - clonename, manufacturer, year added into DriverList (Save)

  - \MAMEoX\Sources\MAMEoXUtil.cpp
    - Added network and directory ini entries to SaveOptions
    - Added "DisableNetworking" option to ensure that networking
      is not started at all if not wanted. For some reason my
      current network setup takes about 40 seconds to boot in debug
      mode, this is a hack until I figure out why.
    - Renamed WaitForNoKey and WaitForKey to WaitForNoButton and
      WaitForAnyButton resp.
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition

  - \MAMEoX\Sources\xbox_FileIO.cpp:
    - Fixed a problem where the file was new'd but not memset to
      0, causing the fileposition and other members to be undefined.

  - \MAME\src\vidhrdw\namcos1.c
    - Reverted back to MAME 0.60 version of this file
      some update after 0.60 made it crash the xbox, but
      works fine on the pc version of MAME. This makes
      namco system 1 games work now, whereas before they
      would load the roms then crash when video was 
      started. (opcode)

  - \Sectionize.pl
    - Updated to dump two imagebld.switch files, one for
      debug, one for release. Hopefully this can be used
      to eliminate the need to unload a ton of sections
      before executing each ROM
    - Updated to also sectionize CPU files
    - Fixed a stupid mistake that may have caused some
      driver files not to be loaded when they should've
      been.

  - \imageblddbg.switch
  - \imagebld.switch
  - \DBGMAMEoX_XBE.bat
  - \MAMEoX_XBE.bat
    - Added files necessary to generate MAMEoX.xbe without
      preloaded XBE sections.
    - These files were immediately removed, as I didn't like
      the way it ended up working, did some profiling, and
      realized that it wasn't making a noticeable difference
      (even in debug mode)

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\main.cpp
    - Hopefully disabled memory card initialization, as it
      causes crashes
    - Improved error messages for missing files
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
    - Added LAUNCH_RUN_AS_IF_REBOOTED command to properly handle
      case where MAMEoX.xbe is started instead of default.xbe
    - clonename, manufacturer, year added into DriverList Load)

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Includes\ROMList.h
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\ROMList.cpp
    - Save superscroll index when launching the utility XBE
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\Help.cpp
    - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
    - Turned off cursor highlighting
    - Changed text color to blue from green

  - \MAMEoXLauncher\Sources\OptionsPage.cpp
      - Adaptations for CGamepad addition
      - Added read-only pages for network and directory options

  - \ZLIB\ZLIB.vcproj
  - \MAMEoXLauncher\MAMEoXLauncher.vcproj
  - \MAMEoX\MAMEoX.vcproj
  - \MAME\MAME.vcproj
  - \libsmb++\libsmb.vcproj
    - Changed all debug versions to use single-threaded debug
      lib to stay inline w/ release mode
    - Fixed problem where MAMEoX project attempted to use the
      release mode libsmb in debug mode, making it impossible
      to automatically build from clean in debug mode (unless
      it was done following a release build)
    - Changed MAMEoX XBE to use runtime checking on uninitialized
      vars and stack validity in debug mode, led to discovery of
      an apparent stack overflow and slight increase of stack size

 --- Specific Game fixes --------------------------------------------
  Ataxx
  Asylum
  Alex Kidd (Set 1) - The ROM is tagged as non-working, but no longer crashes
  U.S. Classic
  Hyper Sports
  Hyper Olympics '84

*********************************************************************
Version 0.65b
  - Fixed a slight glitch in rendering where a grey/white
    bar would show on the left and right of the rendered
    frame. (opcode)

  - Fixed Sound, I think sound is nearly if not 100%
    correct, it sounds exactly like my win32 port
    of MAME as far as I can tell anyway.  Also, sound
    will output to all available speakers, sounds better
    if you have a 5.1 system IMHO. (opcode)

  - Fixed the XDK file debacle, now any files
    that the project references from the xdk will
    now work on any xdk as long as the xdk defined
    the environment variable XDK to point to the
    base dir of the xdk (I think all current xdks
    do this). (opcode)

  - Removed all _RPTx macro calls as they apparently don't
    properly send to xboxwatson.

    Opcode (5/25/03):
  ------------------
    - Added Network settings to INI file
    - Added File Path settings to the INI file
    - Moved INI file to always be in U:\4d414d45\INI\MAMEoX.ini
    - Added SMB support for loading files (ROMS!!) from smb shares
      format of smb share is exactly like xbox media player,
      i.e. smb://user:password@computer/sharedirectory
      as of this release files can only be READ from shares, not Written
    - Changed file handling to not cache files into memory but
      rather load them like the mame core does (not sure if this saves
      memory or not, can't hurt though.)
  ------------------

  - \MAMEoX\Includes\DebugLogger.h
