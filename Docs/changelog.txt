Version 0.65b
  - Fixed a slight glitch in rendering where a grey/white
    bar would show on the left and right of the rendered
    frame. (opcode)

  - Fixed Sound, I think sound is nearly if not 100%
    correct, it sounds exactly like my win32 port
    of MAME as far as I can tell anyway.  Also, sound
    will output to all available speakers, sounds better
    if you have a 5.1 system IMHO. (opcode)

  - Fixed the XDK file debacle, now any files
    that the project references from the xdk will
    now work on any xdk as long as the xdk defined
    the environment variable XDK to point to the
    base dir of the xdk (I think all current xdks
    do this). (opcode)

  - Changed the include path for the
    XDK files to an environment var
    XDK_SAMPLES

    Opcode (5/25/03):
  ------------------
    - Added Network settings to INI file
    - Added File Path settings to the INI file
    - Moved INI file to always be in U:\4d414d45\INI\MAMEoX.ini
    - Added SMB support for loading files (ROMS!!) from smb shares
      format of smb share is exactly like xbox media player,
      i.e. smb://user:password@computer/sharedirectory
      as of this release files can only be READ from shares, not Written
    - Changed file handling to not cache files into memory but
      rather load them like the mame core does (not sure if this saves
      memory or not, can't hurt though.)
