Split XBE debugging HOWTO:


1) Add a CHECKRAM() call (make sure it's all caps)
   to the top of MAMEoXLauncher (main.cpp) and/or MAMEoX
   (xbox_Main.cpp).
 
2) Start up the XBE that you want to debug (play a ROM
   to debug MAMEoX, quit a ROM to debug MAMEoXLauncher).
   It will immediately print out the available memory 
   on the screen and wait for gamepad input. Don't press 
   anything yet.
 
3) Set breakpoint for just after the CHECKRAM() call so
   the debugger will stop immediately after being attached.

4) Set the startup project to the project you wish to debug.
   Press the RUN button (or F5) and choose to Attach to
   the running XBE.
 
5) Press a button on the gamepad (note that it may take
   a few seconds while the debugger is loading up) 
   and debug away.
