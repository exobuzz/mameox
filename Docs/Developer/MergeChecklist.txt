1) Tag the main branch (ex: "T_PRE_MAME_068_MERGE")


2) Checkout a fresh copy of the repository with using branch tag "B_MAME"

	create->Checkout Module
	Checkout Settings tab:
		Module name: MAMEoX
	Checkout Options tab:
		By revision/tag/branch, set the name to "B_MAME"



3) Merge the new release into the checked out code. You should also compile the Windows
	binary to verify that the source release is OK, and to have something to benchmark
	against.



4) Commit the changes and create a tag on the merged dir. This tag should start w/ "I" for "Integrated"
	("I_MAME_068", for example) Note that it is vitally important that you tag the merged code! 
	Also, make sure you do a "cvs add" on any newly created files, and a "cvs remove" on any obsolete
	files.




5a) If this is the first merge ever: (It's not :))
	Checkout a clean copy of the head branch (no sticky tags) with the -j option to merge in the
	branch:

	CMDLINE: cvs checkout -kk -d -j B_MAME MAMEoX

	================================================================================
	WinCVS: 
		create->Checkout Module
		Checkout Settings tab:
			Module name: MAMEoX
		Merge Options tab: 
			"Only this rev./tag", set the name to "B_MAME"
	================================================================================

	Note that it's very important to pass the -d option (create missing directories) to ensure
	a proper merge!




5b) If this is the 2nd+ merge of the branch:
	Checkout a clean copy of the head branch (no sticky tags)

	Then:
	CMDLINE: cvs update -kk -d -j <Tag from last merge on the B_MAME branch> -j B_MAME

	================================================================================
	WinCVS:
		I'm not positive that this op can be done via wincvs
		(without just using the admin->command line stuff). It's
		possible that it could be done w/ the Merge Options tab,
		doing a "Plus w/ this tag" and putting the second most recent 
		milestone tag first, B_MAME second. 

	(You can find the tag from the last merge by doing a cvs log on the sln file and
		taking the most recent M_* tag)
	================================================================================

	Note that it's very important to pass the -d option (create missing directories) to ensure
	a proper merge!



6) Resolve any conflicts



7) TEST THE FULLY MERGED BUILD!



8) Commit the verified changes



9) Tag the merged tree with the "M_" prefix (for "Merged") (ex: "M_MAME_068"). 
	Again, it is very important that you remember to tag!
